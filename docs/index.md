# Status

**This is highly experimental, unfinished, work in progress.**

If you're looking for something you can use, they try again later...

The reason I'm publishing packages and documentation publically is
because this is part of my continuous integration system.

As soon as the code is usable and has sufficient features, I will
publish it as version 1.0.

Anything with a version lower than 1.0 is not guarented to work as the
documentation said, althrough I will publish only version of the
code that pass the build and the test steps.
